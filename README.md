# It's another RUB login but this one is blazingly fast!

## Why?
Most of the tools to do this are written in Python. My Dream Machine has an unsupported version of Python therefore I needed another way. For me it was comfortable to use a compiled language so I can copy it directly run it without installing packages.

## How?

```
git clone https://github.com/FlorianB-DE/blazingly-fast-RUB-login.git

cargo run
```
